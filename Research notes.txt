ðŸ”¹ What Makes a Password Strong?
- **Length:** Longer passwords are exponentially harder to crack.
- **Character Variety:** Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- **Unpredictability:** Avoid common words, sequences, or personal info.
- **Passphrases:** Combine random words for both security and memorability.

ðŸ”¹ Common Password Attacks
1. **Brute Force Attack**  
   - Tries all possible combinations until the password is found.
   - Strong passwords take significantly longer to crack.
   
2. **Dictionary Attack**  
   - Uses a list of common words and passwords.
   - Avoid dictionary words to prevent this.

3. **Credential Stuffing**  
   - Hackers use stolen credentials from one breach to log in elsewhere.
   - Prevent by using different passwords for each account.

4. **Phishing**  
   - Tricks you into giving up your password via fake sites or emails.
   - Prevent by verifying links and using MFA.

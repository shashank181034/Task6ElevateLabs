# 🔐 Password Strength Evaluation - Cyber Security Internship (Task 6)

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong by:
- Creating passwords of varying complexity.
- Testing them with an online password strength checker.
- Analyzing feedback to identify best practices.
- Researching common password attacks and their prevention.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Password Strength Checker:** [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/)
- **Platform:** GitHub for documentation & submission

---

## 📂 Process

### 1️⃣ Create Password Samples
I created multiple passwords with different levels of complexity:
- Weak (short, no symbols)
- Medium (includes numbers & uppercase)
- Strong (includes numbers, uppercase, lowercase, symbols, long length)
- Very Strong ( includes numbers, uppercase, lowercase, symbols, long length, no repeating lowercase or uppercase (2+), no repeating numbers(2+). 

### 2️⃣ Test Each Password
I tested each password on [PasswordMeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com/) and recorded:
- Score (0–100%)
- Strength feedback
- Suggestions for improvement

## 📊 Results

| Password Example          | Score |             Strength Feedback                 |
|---------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `123456789`               | 4%    | Too short, only numbers, easily guessable.    |
| `mypassword`              | 10%   | Only lowercase letters, no symbols/numbers.   |
| `p@ssword3`               | 48%   | Good mix, but still common pattern.           |
| `p@$$w0rd`                | 74%   | Strong, includes all character types.         |
| `P@$sW0rD5*3`             | 100%  | Excellent, long & complex.                    |
